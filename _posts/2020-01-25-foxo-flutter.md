## The Project
Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. I have been meaning to play around with it for a while and have just recently decided to take it upon my self to write a Flutter app! I decided to rewrite an app I wrote a few years ago using Cordova using Flutter instead.

# My Experience
I found it very enjoyable to write my first Flutter app. Coming from a JavaScript and React background, Dart was relatively easy to pick up. Their documentation is very helpful and they have many guide and videos which helped me if I had any questions along the way. I have some more ideas which I plan on implementing with Flutter in the future!
