Palette is an app I created for colorizing user interfaces. Palette makes it extraordinarily simple
to add stunning colors and designs to your interface. If you are a web developer, this is a must have.
Simply touch the color you want, along with the form you want it in (RGB, Hex, etc.) Now, you can
easily paste the color into your favorite text editor on any iPhone, iPad, or Mac! It's that simple,
just touch, paste, repeat. Enjoy, and stay colorful!

Palette was created with Cordova and App.js. It is a hybrid mobile application capable of being deployed
to iOS, Android, or Windows mobile devices. If you would like to learn more about building mobile apps
with Cordova and App.js, I wrote a blog post on it which can here found
[here]({{site.url}}/blog/cordova-app).
