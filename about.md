üï∑Ô∏è Much like a spider, I am a web developer by nature. However, I have a wide background in many other technologies. I am a software engineer with a bachelors degree in computer science from [**The College of New Jersey**](http://tcnj.pages.tcnj.edu). With a strong passion for technology, I am always expanding my knowledge with the current trends and [**latest advancements**](http://www.dwavesys.com/quantum-computing) in the field. Check out my [**resume**](https://represent.io/scottbouloutian).

## My Favorite Activities:

* Developing a fun and useful coding project
* Hitting the gym and pursuing new fitness goals
* Adventuring, hiking, and exploring new areas of the world
* [Maplestory 2](https://maplestory2.nexon.net/en) and other games
* Philosophy, introspection, and meditation
